General info:
* the talk's title:
    Maybe it's not Python that sucks, maybe it's my code.

* a very short abstract/description/teaser (one paragraph, max 2-3 short phrases) with your main take-away message:
    Did you know that that integers from -5 to 257 are pre-allocated in Python for a faster access, so if reuse them 1000 times instead of allocating memory for a bigger integer, you will save a whopping 1 millisecond of code's execution time ? Isn't that thrilling ? Well, this talk is not so detailed. Instead, I will give you examples when sets are better than lists, what is better than "for loops" and how much faster can your code be if you use built-in functions.

* (recommended) 1-2 hashtags that people could use when discussing your topic on social.cern.ch or Twitter:
    #Python, #BestPractices

* (optional) link(s) to relevant websites, articles, blogs etc. if any (but max 2):
* whether you can play your slides (if any) from the conference room PC (preferably: yes), or you need to connect your own laptop:
    Yes (I will use github pages for the presentation, so they can be opened from any computer)

* whether you agree to be video-recorded and webcast (preferably: yes):
    yes
