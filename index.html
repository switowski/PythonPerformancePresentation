						Note:
						Hi guys, before we start - a quick question. How many of you are programming in Python ?

					<script type="text/template">
						<img data-src="./img/zen.png">

						Note:
						Cool, so I guess quite a lot of you are familiar with "The Zen of Python" saying that there should be only one way to do something.
						However, if you come from a different language this "one" way might not be so "obvious".
						Sometimes there can be a huge performance gap between two programming structures that are producing the same results.
						More often, the performance difference won't be that huge, but if you have many small improvements they will add up.'

						With: <code class="good">IPython</code> and it's magic function <code class="good">%timeit</code>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						So let me show you some examples with benchmarks.
						The numbers are not important. What is important is how easily you can get some speed improvements.

					<h4><span class="orange">#1</span> Count elements in list</h4>
					<pre><code class='python'># SLOW
how_many = 0
for element in BIG_LIST:
    how_many += 1
print how_many</pre></code>
							<pre><code class='python'># FAST
print len(array)</pre></code>
					<p>For 1 000 000 elements it's <span class="bad">26.5 ms</span> vs <span class="good">96.7 ns</span>
					<img data-src="./img/over9000.jpg"><br />
					<span class="good">274 000</span> times faster actually</p>

					<aside class="notes">
					Let's start with something simple.
					Let's say you want to count the number of elements in a list. You can easily write you own function with just a for loop that increments a variable.
					There is nothing wrong with this code, except that it's slow. You can achieve the same result using the built-in len() function. Any difference ?
					Yes, the second function is way faster.
					So, try to use the built-in functions when you can. There is just a few of them, so it's very easy to remember the most useful ones.

							#### <span class="orange">#2</span> Filter list
							```python
							# SLOW
							output = []
							for element in BIG_LIST:
								if element % 2:
									output.append(element)
							print output

							```
							<p><span class="bad">70 ms</span></p>
							<pre><code class='python'># FAST ?
							print filter(lambda x: x % 2, array)
							</pre></code>
							<p class='fragment'><span class="bad">88.3 ms</span></p>

							Note:
							Let's say you want to filter a list of numbers and select only the odd ones.
							You can again use a loop.
							But I told you before that you can write faster code if you use the built-in functions so you go to the Python manual and find a filter() function there.
							You rewrite your function using filter with a simple lambda inside.
							$$ Aaand it's slower.
							Sooo, is there any way to make it faster ?

						<script type="text/template">
							#### <span class="orange">#2</span> Filter list faster !

							print [item for item in array if item % 2]

							<p><span class="good">54.2 ms</span><br/>
							<span class="good">30%</span> faster than first version<br />
							<span class="good">60%</span> faster than the filter() version</p>

							Note:
							Yes there is ! You can use list comprehension for that. It's faster and (at least for me) it looks better.'

							#### <span class="orange">#3</span> Find element bigger than some number
							List comprehension - slow and inefficient
							```python
							print [i for i in BIG_LIST if i > NUMBER][0]

							```
							<p><span class="bad">36.5 ms</span></p>

							Note:
							Let say you have a list and you want to find the first element bigger than some number.
							Using a list comprehension might sound like a pythonic solution but it is not very efficient,
							because it will iterate over the whole list and we don't need that.'
						</script>

					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							#### <span class="orange">#3</span> Find element bigger than some number
							Loop with break - faster and efficient
							```python
							for element in BIG_LIST:
								if element > NUMBER:
									print element
									break
							```
							<p><span class="good">892 µs</span>(40 times faster)</p>

							Note:
							We can use the loop instead - it might not sound pythonic and fun at all, but it's faster and we don't spend time on useless computations.
							So, as you can see, not always the fancy pythonic solution is the best solution.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							#### <span class="orange">#3</span> Find element bigger than some number
							Generator - fast and reusable
							```python
							gen = (item for item in LIST if item > NUMBER)
							print next(gen)
							```
							<p><span class="good">888 µs</span> - the same as previously</p>
							<p>And now you get next elements even faster !
							```python
							print next(gen)
							print next(gen)
							```
							TODO: benchmark this
							</p>
							Note:
							Nah, I'm just kidding. Of course there is a more pythonic solution than that - a generator.
							It has the same speed performance as loop, but if you want to get more than one element you get them instantly.'

							Note:
							Let say you want to check if an element belongs to a list.
							Most of you know that using this loop is not the best solution
							You can instead use the index function together with some exception handling.
							It is faster and more pythonic because it is using one of the fundamental python rules: "ask for forgiveness, not for permission".

							Note:

							In this case, you might be interested in using a set.
							The lookup time inside a set is constant, so it quickly pays back for the overhead you need to convert list to a set.

						Note:
						 They also have a lot of functions that you can use to check for union, intersection or difference, so please don't use loops for that.
						 For example, to check if one set is a subset of another one, you can use the issubset function, which is faster and more concise.'

						%timeit is your friend

						your_function();
						long elapsedTime = System.nanoTime() - start;
						System.out.println(elapsedTime/1000000);

						Note:
						When in doubts - use timeit. It's just one line of code if you are using IPython (and you should be using IPython)'.
