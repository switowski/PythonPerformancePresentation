						Note:
						I guess quite a lot of you know "The Zen of Python" saying that there should be only one way to do something.<br/>
						However, if you come from a different language this "one" way might not be so "obvious".<br/>
						Sometimes there can be a huge performance gap between two programming structures that are producing the same results.<br/>
						More often, the performance difference won't be that huge, but if you have many small improvements they will add up.'

						So let me show you some examples with benchmarks.<br/>
						The numbers are not important. What is important is how easily you can get some speed improvements.

    how_many += 1
print how_many</pre></code>
							<pre><code class='python'># FAST

						<span class="good">274 000</span> times faster actually
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
					Let's start with something simple.<br/>
					Let's say you want to count the number of elements in a list.<br/>
					You can easily write you own function with just a for loop that increments a variable.<br/>
					There is nothing wrong with this code, except that it's slow.<br/>
					You can achieve the same result using the built-in len() function.<br/>
					As you can see, the difference is quite huge.<br/>
					So, try to use the built-in functions when you can.<br/>
					There is just a few of them, so it's very easy to remember the most useful ones.

							<pre><code class='python'># FAST ?
							print filter(lambda x: x % 2, array)
							</pre></code>
							<p class='fragment'><span class="bad">88.3 ms</span></p>

							Note:
							Let's say you want to filter a list of numbers and select only the odd ones.<br/>
							You can again use a loop.<br/>
							But I told you before that you can write faster code if you use the built-in functions so you go to the Python manual and find a filter() function there.<br/>
							You rewrite your function using filter with a simple lambda inside.<br/>
							$$ Aaand it's slower.<br/>
							Sooo, is there any way to make it faster ?

							<span class="good">60%</span> faster than the filter() version</p>

							Note:
							Yes there is !<br/>

							```
							<p><span class="bad">36.5 ms</span></p>

							Note:
							Let say you have a list and you want to find the first element bigger than some number.<br/>
							Using a list comprehension might sound like a pythonic solution but it is not very efficient,
							because it will iterate over the whole list and we don't need that.'

									print element
									break
							```
							<p><span class="good">892 µs</span>(40 times faster)</p>

							Note:
							We can use the loop instead - it might not sound pythonic and fun at all, but hey, it's faster and we don't spend time on useless computations.<br/>
							However, in Python quite often there is something better than a loop.

					<section data-markdown>

							```
							<p><span class="good">888 µs</span> - the same as previously</p>
							<p>And now you get next elements even faster !
							```python
							print next(gen) # => 50001
							print next(gen) # => 50002
							```
							</p>
							Note:
							And in this case it's called a generator.<br/>
							It has the same speed performance as loop, but if you want to get more than one element you get them instantly.'

							Note:
							Let say you want to check if an element belongs to a list.<br/>
							Most of you know that using this loop is not the best solution.<br/>
							You can instead use the index function together with some exception handling.<br/>
							It is faster and more pythonic because it is using one of the fundamental python rules: "ask for forgiveness, not for permission".

							Note:
							They also have a lot of functions that you can use to check for union, intersection or difference, so please don't use loops for that.<br/>
							For example, to check if one set is a subset of another one, you can use the issubset function, which is faster.'
